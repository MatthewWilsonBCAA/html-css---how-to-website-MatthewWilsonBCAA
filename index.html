        <h3>Step 1: Boot the Game</h3>
        <p>
          This step is pretty simple. Just put the disc in (if you have a
          physical copy), click on it, and let it load to the main menu.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Start the Game</h3>
        <p>
          This step is also pretty easy. Just navigate to the option "New Game"
          and click it.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Learn the Controls</h3>
        <p>
          The controls to this game can get tricky, so be sure to use Helgen as
          a training spot to learn them!

        <h3>Step 1: Go to Riverwood</h3>
        <p>
          This step is marked. Just go to the little river-side town that the
          arrow points you to. Don't forget to save often!
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Do the Main Questline</h3>
        <p>
          Easiest section of our How To. Just follow the arrow and kill enemies
          that get in your way.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Kill Alduin</h3>
        <p>
          By this point, you are an expert, so you should breeze through this
          fight. Just kill the big black dragon with the arrow over it.

        <h2>Section 3: Modding (Part 1)</h2>
        <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="mods-1.jpg" alt="Introduction Scene"></img>
        <h3>Step 1: Go to the Mod menu</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you have beat the game, you are obligated to start downloading mods. First, go
          back to the main menu, and click on the option that says "Mods".
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Pick a cool looking Mod</h3>
        <p>
          There are thousands of options to choose from. Go ahead, find one you like, 
          but I recommend the Beyond Skyrim Mod! Then, when it is finished downloading, 
          install it (varies from Console to PC).
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Play Mod</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you have downloaded and installed the mod, go ahead and boot up your save and
          give it a whirl! 
        </p>

        <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="mods-2.jpg" alt="Introduction Scene"></img>
        <h3>Step 1: Go back to the Mod menu</h3>
        <p>
          Now that you have played around with some mods, you are obligated to start downloading
          as many mods as your device can handle! Go get at least 40.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Play the Mods</h3>
        <p>
          Once you feel like you have a good combination of mods, go ahead and boot your save.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Watch your game crash</h3>
        <p>
          If you have too many mods installed, or the wrong ones, your game is probably going to
          crash. But, sometimes the bugs that originate are entertaining.
