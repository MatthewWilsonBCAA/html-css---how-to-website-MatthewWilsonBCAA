        <h3>Step 1: Boot the Game</h3>
        <p>
          This step is pretty simple. Just put the disc in (if you have a
          physical copy), click on it, and let it load to the main menu.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Start the Game</h3>
        <p>
          This step is also pretty easy. Just navigate to the option "New Game"
          and click it.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Learn the Controls</h3>
        <p>
          The controls to this game can get tricky, so be sure to use Helgen as
          a training spot to learn them!

        <h2>Chapter 2: Most of the Game</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Go to Riverwood</h3>
        <p>
          This step is marked. Just go to the little river-side town that the
          arrow points you to.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 2: Do the Main Questline</h3>
        <p>
          Easiest section of our How To. Just follow the arrow and kill enemies
          that get in your way.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 3: Kill Alduin</h3>
        <p>
          By this point, you are an expert, so you should breeze through this
          fight. Just kill the big black dragon with the arrow over it.
